### IMPORTANT NOTE BEFORE RUN THE PROGRAM ###

1. Make sure there is an empty line at the end of the files first_name.lst, last_name.lst and title.lst so that the jape script could write the new item into files correctly.

2. Absolute path was used in person_new_name.jape and person_new_title.jape. Change 'basePath' before run the scripts.

3. Run person_name.jape for question Part 1; run person_new_name.jape for Part2; run person_part3_main.jape for Part 3.
